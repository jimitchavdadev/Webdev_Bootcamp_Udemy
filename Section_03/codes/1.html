    <h1>Jimit's Recipe for the Best Cinnamon Rolls</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>1/3 cup margarine, melted</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/3 cup butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from
        heat. Let cool until lukewarm.
      </li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups flour and yeast.</li>
      <li>
        Add warm milk, eggs, margarine, salt, and sugar to the flour mixture.
        Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each
        addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly
        floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes. In a
        small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the dough into a 12x9 inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup
        butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough
        and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking
        pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat
        oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
        Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.
      </li>
